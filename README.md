# About
With how many addons I've been writing, I've been noticing I've been using the same scripts over and over again. So, I figured I'd post a quickstart base.

# Using
If you want a quickstart, just use this script if you're on Linux.

```sh
$ curl -o CBCEBase.zip -LJ https://github.com/MatthewSH/CBCE-Addon-Base/archive/master.zip && unzip ./CBCEBase.zip && rm -rf ./CBCEBase.zip
```
